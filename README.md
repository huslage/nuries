Nuries - Shine a light within.

Nuries is a matchstick meditation tool designed to be portable, beautiful, and social. 

Portable: a beautiful box that you keep in your pocket that is beautiful in design and also functions in function to a noPhone: http://www.thenophone.com/ 

Beautiful: Every aspect from the smell of the scented matches, to the image on the box, the tips of the matches and strike area is designed to be beautiful.

Social: Open - This project is on github for a reason. We're keenly interested in making something that helps us all connect with ourselves even for 5 mins a day. Your suggestions submitted on github or our facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/nurielights is most welcome! 


The dream is to make a portable matchstick so entirely beautiful that the experience uplifts you. We hope you'll help us make these things and connect with other Nuries to shine some light where it's dark. 

With lots of love.
